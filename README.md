Module 11 Challenge

In this challenge I will use Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from websites.
In Part I, the site "Mars News" will be scraped to obain news articles titles and arctical
summaries.

In Part II, the site, "Mars Temperature Data" will be scraped. The site has a table, and
I will programatically copy the table and extract the data elments from each row. Then,
I'll conduct some fundamental analyses, plot the data, and answer a few questions.
